[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/BrWProjects/BlackboardAPI%20Builds/_apis/build/status/wbrinksma.BlackboardAPI)](https://dev.azure.com/BrWProjects/BlackboardAPI%20Builds/_build/latest?definitionId=4)

An API to communicate with a Blackboard server. This can be used to build apps on the Blackboard platform that can either be hosten on-site or off-site through the use of special loaders.

This project is still in its infancy, meaning that it will not work fully until a stable release is published.
